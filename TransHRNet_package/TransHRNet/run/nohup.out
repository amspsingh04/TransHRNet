nnUNet_raw_data_base is not defined and nnU-Net can only be used on data for which preprocessed files are already present on your system. nnU-Net cannot be used for experiment planning and preprocessing like this. If this is not intended, please read nnunet/paths.md for information on how to set this up properly.
nnUNet_preprocessed is not defined and nnU-Net can not be used for preprocessing or training. If this is not intended, please read nnunet/pathy.md for information on how to set this up.
RESULTS_FOLDER is not defined and nnU-Net cannot be used for training or inference. If this is not intended behavior, please read nnunet/paths.md for information on how to set this up
